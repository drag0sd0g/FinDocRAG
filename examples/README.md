# FinDocDRAG — API Examples

This directory contains a [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) collection for exploring the FinDocDRAG API and a concrete annotated example showing a real end-to-end query response.

## Opening the collection in Bruno

1. Install Bruno: https://www.usebruno.com/downloads
2. **Open Collection** → select the `examples/bruno/` folder
3. In the top-right environment picker, select **local**
4. Start the stack (`make run` or `make run-remote`) before sending requests

## End-to-end walkthrough

### Step 1 — Ingest a filing

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tickers": ["AAPL"]}'
```

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "tickers_processed": ["AAPL"],
  "filings_published": 3,
  "filings_skipped": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

The embedding worker picks up the Kafka messages, chunks each filing into ~512-token windows, embeds them with `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`, and writes the vectors to pgvector. This takes a few minutes on CPU.

### Step 2 — Query the knowledge base

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-key-1" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What were Apple'\''s main risk factors related to supply chain in their 2024 10-K?",
    "ticker_filter": "AAPL",
    "top_k": 5
  }'
```

**Annotated response:**

```jsonc
{
  // LLM-generated answer grounded in the retrieved chunks.
  // Null when the LLM is unavailable (see "degraded" below).
  "answer": "Apple's 2024 10-K identifies supply chain concentration as a primary risk. The Company sources components including advanced semiconductors, displays, and rare earth materials from a small number of suppliers, many located in Asia. A disruption — whether from geopolitical tension, natural disaster, or a single-supplier failure — could delay product launches and reduce gross margins [Source 1]. Apple also cites logistical dependency on third-party carriers for last-mile delivery, which creates exposure during peak demand periods [Source 2]. Additionally, the Company acknowledges that its contract manufacturers, primarily in China, are subject to local regulatory changes and labour cost inflation that it cannot fully control [Source 3].",

## Tips

- **Auth:** all Query API requests require `X-API-Key: dev-key-1` (set in the `local` environment). Ingestion has no auth.
- **Degraded mode:** stop the Ollama container (`docker stop findoc-ollama`) then send any query — you will receive HTTP 200 with `"degraded": true` and `"answer": null` but the `sources` array will still be populated.
- **Rate limit:** the Query API enforces 30 requests/minute per key. Bruno will receive HTTP 429 if you run the collection in bulk too fast.
- **`top_k` range:** 1–20. At 512 tokens/chunk, 20 chunks ≈ 10 K tokens, fitting within a 32 K-token context window.
